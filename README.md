### Description:

#### Blackjack game built using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Users will be able to interact to play their own Blackjack hands. The MVP for this project will be to create a fully interactive Blackjack game where the user will either stand, achieve BlackJack or bust. There is also a running 'bank' counter to keep track of players overall stance over time.
