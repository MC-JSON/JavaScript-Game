### Description:

#### Blackjack game built using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Users will be able to interact to play their own Blackjack hands. The MVP for this project was to create a fully interactive Blackjack game where the user can either stand, achieve BlackJack or bust. There is also a running 'bank' counter to keep track of players stance over time.
